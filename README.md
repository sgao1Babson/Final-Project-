## Goal
#Learning Goal: 

The learning goal of this project is to utilize and improve the skills we learned in class and apply those in real world issues and subjects. The idea generating logic was quite simple: to solve a real world problem surrounding us. At that time, one of our group members happened to have math homework involved with matrix calculation. So we simply decided to proceed with that. Throughout the completion of this project, we wish to utilize all skills learned in class including both coding skills and collaborative working skills.
## Features

This is a simple 3 * 3 matrix calculator, it can do:

Multiplication 

Addition

Subtraction
## Library 
#import numpy as np

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


#from flask import Flask

#from flask import render_template, url_for,request, redirect
## Run the Codes

Install flask and numpy using pip install (python3 -m pip install if using macOS)

Run matrix_front.py 

Open the local address the codes generate: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Enjoy this sweet tool we created for you
